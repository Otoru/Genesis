# Install Genesis

First off all, we recommend using the latest version of Python.

Within the environment you want to use to work, use the following command to install Genesis:

```bash
pip install genesis 
```

Genesis is now installed. Go to the [documentation](https://github.com/Otoru/Genesis/wiki) overview to start to work.
